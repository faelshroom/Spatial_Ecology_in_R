Spatial structure of populatioins, communities and ?

Link between the variables of individuals and the life of them

Concept of population, density (relate both to immigration, emigration, births and deaths)

3 main patterns of dispersion of populations: Clumped, uniform and random

Book Jungle of randomness

In the case of the randomness, they seem to be random but there might be a rule that decides that, like a higher presence of nutrients

**Demography** is the study of the vital statistics of a population and how they change over time

Type I,II and III

We usually will study idealized situations

$${\Delta N / \Delta t}= rN$$

**Carrying capacity (K)** maximum amount of individuals that the environemtn can support

Sigmoid curve (or logistic curve)
And also the Exponential growth curve

the threshold of human beings in the graph is when a limitng factor is reached like the limitation of water or food and resources

division of species into r and K species, depending also on the competition value

Metapopulaions are groups of populations linked by immigration and emigration, higher survival can result in greater stability in populations
